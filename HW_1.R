#The KM survival time tells you the probability of survival over time. The y-axis has the cumulative survival rate which takes into account the people that remain at risk, and the x-axis is time passed (since start of study for example). Thus the y-intercept can tell you the time as the cumulative survival changes.  The x-intercept can tell you the cumulative survival rate within a specified time. 
 
#You need to use survObj to tell the program the response variable (the follow-up time and whether there was death of each patient, eg censorship and its direction).
